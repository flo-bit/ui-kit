## Build apps fast

This ui kit's main aim is to help you build webapps that look good very fast.

It's not designed to be super customizable, but instead offers you a
bunch of good-looking-by-default components.

## Two colors

Still all apps looking the same is kinda boring, so there are is one easy and quick way to customize all components.

The main idea is having two colors (in all tailwind shades from 50 up to 950):

- base color (usually one of the 5 tailwind gray tones)
- accent color (usually one of the not-gray tailwind colors)

You can try it out by setting the current theme colors in the navbar for this documentation site.

## Lots of components

While currently only the base components are visible, there are lots of components in the pipeline.
The aim is to have a component library that has lots of components that are useful for building webapps/websites/games, all in a consistent style/theme.

See here for a few examples of work in progress components (some may be partially broken):

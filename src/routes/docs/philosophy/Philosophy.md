# Philosophy

<PublicAlphaAlert />

## Build apps fast

This ui kit's main aim is to help you build webapps that look good very fast.

It's not designed to be super customizable, but instead offers you a
bunch of good-looking-by-default components.

## Two colors

Still all apps looking the same is kinda boring, so there are some easy and quick ways to customize all components.

The main idea is having two colors:

- base color (usually one of the 5 tailwind gray tones)
- accent color (usually one of the not-gray tailwind colors)

You can try it out by setting the current theme colors in the navbar for this documentation site.
